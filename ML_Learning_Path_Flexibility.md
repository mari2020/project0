## Flexible Learning Paths

### Path 1: Traditional Sequential Path
**For beginners with no ML background**
- Start with ML Fundamentals
- Progress through all modules in order
- Best for comprehensive understanding

### Path 2: Modern AI Focus
**For those wanting to focus on recent AI advances**
- **Prerequisites**: Basic Python, basic ML concepts (can be learned concurrently)
- **Starting Point**: Module 4.1 (Transformer Architectures)
- **Suggested backfill**: Neural network basics from Module 2.1 when needed

### Path 3: Applied ML Systems Focus
**For those interested in building practical ML systems**
- **Prerequisites**: Basic programming knowledge
- **Starting Point**: Module 1.1 → Module 2.2 (decision trees) → Module 4.4 (MLOps)
- **Skip initially**: Advanced math-heavy topics

### Path 4: Generative AI Focus
**For those interested specifically in generative models**
- **Prerequisites**: Basic programming, basic neural networks
- **Starting Point**: Module 2.1 (Neural Networks) → Module 4.3 (Generative AI)
- **Suggested backfill**: Other topics as needed

## Topic Priority and Prerequisites Table

| Topic | Priority | Hard Prerequisites | Recommended Prerequisites | Can Skip If |
|-------|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Linear/Logistic Regression** | High for beginners | Basic calculus, Python | None | Already familiar with ML |
| **Neural Networks Basics** | High | Linear algebra, Python | Linear regression | None - fundamental |
| **Decision Trees** | Medium | Python | None | Focusing on deep learning only |
| **Clustering** | Medium | Python | None | Focusing on supervised learning |
| **Transformers** | Very High (2025) | Python | Neural networks basics | Focusing on classical ML only |
| **Large Language Models** | Very High (2025) | Python | Transformer basics | Not working with text/language |
| **Diffusion Models** | High (2025) | Python | Neural networks basics | Not interested in image generation |
| **RAG Systems** | Very High (2025) | Python | Basic LLM understanding | Not building AI assistants |
| **MLOps** | High for industry | Python | At least one ML model type | Academic focus only |
| **Responsible AI** | Medium-High | None | Experience with one ML system | None - important for all practitioners |

## Topic Interconnections

Some topics are highly interconnected while others can be learned in isolation. Here's a guide to those connections:

### Highly Independent Topics (Can Learn Separately)
- Traditional ML algorithms (regression, trees)
- Basic clustering techniques
- Recommender system basics
- Reinforcement learning fundamentals

### Interconnected Topics (Best Learned Together)
- Neural networks → Deep learning → Transformers → LLMs
- Supervised learning fundamentals → Evaluation metrics → MLOps
- LLMs → RAG → Production AI systems

## Conclusion

The machine learning field has become increasingly modular, allowing practitioners to specialize in specific areas without mastering everything. The paths above provide options based on your interests and career goals.

For 2025, the most in-demand skills are in the Large Language Model ecosystem, generative AI, and production ML systems, but the foundational skills remain valuable for deeper understanding.

Choose your path based on:
1. Your existing technical background
2. Your specific interests and goals
3. The time you have available to learn

Remember that ML is an iterative learning process - you'll often return to earlier topics with new understanding as you progress.
